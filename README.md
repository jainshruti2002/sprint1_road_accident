Problem Statement :-
Road accidents are a big problem worldwide. They lead to injuries, loss of lives, and financial costs. By studying accident data, we can help traffic managers and city planners understand how to reduce these accidents.

This project aims to analyze accident data to find answers to important questions like:
When and where do most accidents happen?
What are the main causes of accidents?
How do age, weather, and road conditions affect accidents?
What types of vehicles and drivers are involved most often?

Some key insights is here :-  
Accident Count by Weather Conditions -
Clear weather has the highest number of accidents, while foggy weather accounts for the least.

Accidents by Light Conditions -
Most accidents occur during daylight, followed by dark but street-lit conditions.

Accidents by Road Surface Conditions - 
Dry road conditions see the highest accidents, whereas snowy conditions have the least.

Accidents by Speed Limit -
Speed limits between 30-40 mph see the highest accidents compared to other speed limits.


Conclusion :-
This project looked at road accidents to find out when, where, and why they happen. It showed when accidents happen the most, where they are common, and the main reasons for them. It also looked at how weather, driversâ€™ ages, and road conditions affect accidents.

This information helps make roads safer, reduce accidents, and save lives. It can be used to make better rules, fix roads, teach safe driving, and help emergency teams respond faster.
